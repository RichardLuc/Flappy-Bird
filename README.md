# Flappy-Bird
I made a replica of the original Flappy Bird game with python.

# Initial Goals From Finishing This Project
- Gain game design skills [ ]
- Improve my python skills [x]
- Gain experience reading documents on non-standard library [x]

# What I Learned
Working on this project definitely improved my python skills. I learned a bit about OOP.  
I learned that reading documents can be difficult if you are not familiar with the library.  

# Things I Can Improve On/ Do In The Future
I need to work on my coding structure for python. I need look up standard coding practices for a new programming language I have not yet worked with it, before starting my first code for it.  
If I want to learn more about game design and programming for video games, I should work on a more difficult video game project. I already learned how to make a video game, back when I worked on a platformer game on unity.

# Thought Process Throughout The Process
1. I decided to work on a Flappy Bird clone, because I was bored and I needed to improve my coding skills. I thought working on this project will be a great, because it seems fun and informative.  
2. I found pygame which is a non-standard library that allows the user to create video games on python. I did some research on pygame and I found this helpful PDF (https://inventwithpython.com/makinggames.pdf) that helped me get started.  
3. I started to work on my project after that. Anytime I was receiving syntax errors, I looked over at the pygame document to fix them.

# Time It Took To Complete This Project
About a week
